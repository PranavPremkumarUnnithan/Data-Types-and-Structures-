        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A data structure is a way to organize and store data so it can be used efficiently.\n",
        "  - They make tasks like searching, sorting, and updating data faster.\n",
        "  - They are used in apps, websites, games, and other programs to handle data smartly.\n",
        "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutable:   Can be changed after creation.\n",
        "   -Examples:  Dictionary,List\n",
        "   -Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation\n",
        "   -Examples:  String,Tuple\n",
        "3.  What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "   - List:-\n",
        "   -List: Can change\n",
        "   -List: Use [ ]\n",
        "   -List: Slower\n",
        "   -List: Use when data changes.\n",
        "   -Tuple:-\n",
        "   -Tuple: Cannot change after creation.\n",
        "   -Tuple: Use ()\n",
        "   -Tuple: Faster\n",
        "   -Tuple: Use when data stays the same\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.\n",
        "  -Keys are converted into a special number called a hash.\n",
        "  -This number decides where the data is stored in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A set keeps only unique items.\n",
        "  - Checking if an item is in a set is quicker than in a list.\n",
        "  - Easy to find common or different items between sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -A string is a sequence of characters, like \"hello\" or \"123\".\n",
        "  -Strings are immutable, meaning once created, you can’t change the characters inside them.\n",
        "  -Mutability,Syntax,Length\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Tuples ensure data integrity by encrypting the data inside them, making it secure and unchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -A hash table is a data structure that stores data as key-value pairs.\n",
        "  -It uses a hash function to convert keys into unique numbers.\n",
        "  -Dictionaries in Python are built using hash tables.\n",
        "  -Keys are hashed to find their place in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Lists can hold numbers, strings, booleans, and even other lists or objects, all in one list.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Immutable means you can't change a string after it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Strings are immutable to Save Memory& Make Strings Safe\n",
        "  -Improve Performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Fast Lookups\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Key-Value Pairs\n",
        "\n",
        "  -No Duplicates in Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use a tuple when the data should not change.\n",
        "  - Example Scenario:\n",
        "  -Storing Coordinates:\n",
        "  -Tuples are great for fixed data like coordinates because they are immutable.\n",
        "  -Use a tuple when you need fixed, unchanging data like dates & coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "  - Sets automatically remove duplicates.\n",
        "  - If you try to add a duplicate value, it will be ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For Lists:Checks if a value is in the list.\n",
        "   - For Dictionaries:Checks if a key is in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "   - Immutable means the data cannot be changed after the tuple is created.\n",
        "   - This design helps ensure the data stays safe and consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries inside it.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Ex:a nested dictionary to organize related data, like storing information about different people.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Nested dictionaries make it easier to manage and access related data in one structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Accessing a Value.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Accessing an element in a dictionary is very fast.\n",
        "   - Dictionaries use a hash table to store data.\n",
        "   - The key is converted into a hash, which directly points to the values location.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Order Matters:Use a list if the order of items is important.\n",
        "  - Simple Data: Use a list for storing simple values without labels.\n",
        "  - No Keys Needed:Use a list when you don’t need to label items.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Dictionaries don't keep items in the order you add them.\n",
        " - Instead, items are stored based on their hash values in memory.\n",
        " - Order Doesn't Matter.\n",
        " - Fast Lookups\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n",
